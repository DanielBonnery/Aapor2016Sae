#Big Data for Small Areas, Aapor2016Sae package
Aapor2016Sae is an R package for the short course "Big Data for Small Areas"


##Course Overview:
There is an increasing interest in producing public opinion statistics for small geographic regions or various demographic groups using data from national opinion polls, which are often conducted with a sample of around 1000. The main problem for producing such estimates is that there may be very little or no information for the small areas from such a poll. As a result, the standard sample survey estimates for small areas are either non-existent or highly unreliable. One of the key factors that lead to the success of the advanced small area methodology, which typically uses implicit or explicit models to combine survey and administrative data sources, is the availability of strong auxiliary databases. The accessibility of big data from different sources is now bringing new opportunities for statisticians to develop innovative small area methods for producing public opinion statistics. An overview of the current state of small area research will be discussed. Followed by an understanding of the potential for the use of big data in producing reliable small area public opinion statistics.

##Course Objectives:
* Why standard survey methods do not work in small area estimation (SAE).
* Describe a few examples of big data and discuss their potential use in small area estimation.
* How can one combine survey data with big data in improving SAE statistics?
